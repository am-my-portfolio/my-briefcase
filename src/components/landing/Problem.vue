        Market - But they lack the resources to compete

              Solopreneurs and small businesses cannot afford to hire a team of
              experts in every area of their business, nor can they use existing
              SaaS tools that are often expensive and not tailored to their
              specific needs. With The Briefcase, solopreneurs and small
              businesses can have access to the same level of expertise and
              efficiency as a large corporation, without the high cost.
